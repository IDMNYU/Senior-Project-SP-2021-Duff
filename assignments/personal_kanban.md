**Break down** EVERYTHING you need to do for **your project into actionable tasks.** One method is [Personal Kanban](http://personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-101/), but you may have your own.  
  
All actionable tasks should start with a verb \(i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.\) and be visible in some way \(not in your head\).

I recommend using an analog, digital, or analog/digital combination.

* post-it notes on a wall or mini ones in a notebook \(so you can move them around\),
* [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) \(many students use this method\) or
* a digital representation of your milestones using [kanbanery.com](http://kanbanery.com) or another digital platform of your choice.

The columns I recommend for Personal Kanban \(but you are not limited to\) are:

* To-Do \(I recommend keeping a monthly and weekly one.\)
* Today \(Work-In-Progress \(WIP\) limit of 3 to 5 maximum\)
* Waiting For \(OPTIONAL\)
* Done
