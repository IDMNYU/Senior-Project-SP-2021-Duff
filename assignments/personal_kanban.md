# Time & Project Management

![Big Things Happen One Day At A Time llustration by Jolby from gettoworkbook](../.gitbook/assets/gettoworkbook_big-things-happen-one-day-at-a-time.jpg)

I expect you to have systems to manage your time and your projects.

## _Time Management_

It is imperative that you keep an analog or digital calendar. I actually keep both.

## Track Your Actionable Tasks and Progress

You need to create a system to track your actionable tasks and progress \(aka making sure you are getting your project tasks done\).

**Break down** EVERYTHING you need to do for **your project into actionable tasks.**   
  
All actionable tasks should start with a verb \(i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.\) and be visible in some way \(not in your head\).

You should make your actionable tasks VISIBLE in a calendar and/or planner or journal. \(See suggestions below\).

One method is [Personal Kanban](http://personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-101/), but you may have your own. The columns I recommend for Personal Kanban \(but you are not limited to\) are:

* To-Do \(I recommend keeping two: monthly and weekly.\)
* Today \(Work-In-Progress \(WIP\) limit of 3 to 5 maximum\)
* Waiting For \(OPTIONAL\)
* Done

Another popular method is [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/). 

_I personally use a combination of both._

## Recommended Visible Systems

The most highly recommended planner or journal by students is the __[**Bullet Journal**](https://bulletjournal.com/)**.** It's a system. You only need to use a pen and paper or a digital tablet to engage. In other words, there's no journal to buy.

I recommend having an analog or digital personal kanban using \*[Asana](https://asana.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/) \(or [Kanbanery](https://kanbanery.com/)\).

The analog method is having post-it notes on a wall or mini ones in a notebook \(so you can move them around\),

## Recommended Planners

I personally use an un-dated digital version of the ink and volt planner. I've gone back and forth between the first three. Planners are personal. You have to figure out what works for you, and as you grow as a professional, your planner needs may change.
