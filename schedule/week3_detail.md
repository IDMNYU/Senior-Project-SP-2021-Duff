# Week 3 Detail Feb 18

## Deliverables \(DUE ON DATE LISTED\)

* Read [letters from a previous cohort](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fr1cw72xTrvwSBTM6Bh9OU2XepJ1YNOk) \(if you didn't last week\). I also added some additional ones from Spring 2020.
* Write a response to 1 or more of the letters from the previous cohort and post it in the \#duff slack channel. Did you notice any trends? What are 1 to 3 key takeaways for you? What advice will you take to heart? I'm sure different letters will resonate with different students. Make sure you read as many as you can.
* [Research and design](../project_plan/) your project.
* Document your process and project, which includes your [research and design](../project_plan/), on your [process website](../pre-work/website.md).
