Kelsa Trom is a writer and cultural organizer focused on participatory learning and community. She brings a multidisciplinary background across service design, communications, education, strategy, and research with a  focus on driving social change through art and design. Her projects in ceramics, writing experiments, and movement arts explore the interplay between the body, public and private gestures, memory, and everyday life.  She will be discussing the mission of NEW INC as a creative incubator for artists, designers, creative technologists, and activists to fully produce and implement their visions. Also, the programming that she organizes to offer as inspiration or catalyst for creatives in the program to find strategies and means to produce their dream projects.
* The 2nd hour: we'll continue with the [Project Demos](../critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/project_demo.md) class critique at a different zoom link.
