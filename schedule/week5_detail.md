## Deliverables \(DUE ON DATE LISTED\)

* Meet with your [accountability team ](../assignments/accountability_partner.md)at least once, this week.

  BEFORE you revise your pro practices materials, watch the following videos I created last Spring \(listed below\) to anticipate feedback I might give to you this semester. 

* My feedback may vary from your pro practices instructor. Identify these variances and reflect on why the feedback is different in some cases. Post in the \#duff slack channel. Be prepared to discuss these differences during class. I will make new ones for this class after you submit your Pro Practices Material Revisions.
