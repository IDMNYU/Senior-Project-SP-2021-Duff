 **May 2020, Exact Date & Time TBD** 

Attendance is MANDATORY for the entire duration of the showcase!!

Your senior project will be publicly shown in the IDM showcase at the end of the semester \(date to be determined\). Exhibiting your work is truly a gift of accomplishment, response, and feedback.

* **Show Your Work:** Your project should be as complete as humanly possible. You will exhibit your senior project publicly in the IDM Showcase. If you don't understand the importance and benefits of exhibiting your work, I HIGHLY recommend that you read [Show Your Work!](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered-ebook/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420589663&sr=8-1&keywords=show+the+work+austin+kleon) by Austin Kleon NOW \([Cheat Sheet](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1384352860i/6856374._SY540_.jpg)\).
