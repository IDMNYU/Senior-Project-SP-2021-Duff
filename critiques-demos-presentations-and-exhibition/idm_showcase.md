 **May 11, 2020, Exact Time TBD** 

Participation is MANDATORY for the end of semester showcase!!

At a minimum providing us with the following materials by the end of the month:

1\) A one minute video that explains their project   
2\) a URL to view the project \(can be a video link, documentation, live site, etc\)   
3\) an image that represents the project \(can be of the thing itself, a graphic treatment, etc\)   
4\) text describing the project   
5\) project title

Students may also submit additional media- images, videos- as appropriate.

Your senior project will be publicly shown in the IDM showcase at the end of the semester \(date to be determined\). Exhibiting your work is truly a gift of accomplishment, response, and feedback.

* **Show Your Work:** Your project should be as complete as humanly possible. You will exhibit your senior project publicly in the IDM Showcase. If you don't understand the importance and benefits of exhibiting your work, I HIGHLY recommend that you read [Show Your Work!](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered-ebook/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420589663&sr=8-1&keywords=show+the+work+austin+kleon) by Austin Kleon NOW \([Cheat Sheet](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1384352860i/6856374._SY540_.jpg)\).
