# Project Presentation



* Despite giving an accompanying presentation with or without slides, your project demo should be the primary focus of project presentation.
* With many presentations, folks talk about their project, but spend either less time or no time showing us their project. In other words, it's better to integrate the talking with the showing of your project. 
* Use the [project plan](../project_plan/) sections as a template for your visual presentation. The project plan is just a guideline for information for your presentation. It is up to you to decide which areas you want to focus on. In some cases, you might omit a section if you think the class remembers key ideas from your previous presentation.
* Post the link in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EfXgca1QsOS6xNGzMvSjeAmHDSRgqK2bK1CTrJRPoNU/edit) before class begins.

Each presentation will consist of:

* 7 minutes of presentation and 
* 7 minutes of Q&A

  \(or a combination thereof\)

  for 14 minutes total.

## Invite guests

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to _at least_ one of their project critiques, demos, or presentations. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. A one on one, documented meeting \(date, time, length, and typed notes\) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you. Document the feedback that you receive on your [process website](../pre-work/website.md).

## Document your feedback

Always document any feedback you receive on your [process website]() after any critique. This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project \(prototype or version\), a description of your project progress as it currently stands and discussion of the feedback your received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?
