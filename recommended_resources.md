## NYU Resources

* [NYU IDM Job Postings on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8684560/)
* [NYU Global Awards](http://nyu.edu/scholarships) \(Fulbright, Marshall, Rhodes, etc.\). Remember your contact is Kristofor Larsen, kristofor.larsen@nyu.edu.

  **Students** can get free headshots from the NYU Photo Bureau. I highly recommend that you take advantage of it for your portfolio website and LinkedIn profile. It's a very popular service. You just need to book it \(sometimes weeks\) in advance. The NYU photo bureau is currently moving locations. So they're not taking any appointments until February.

  * Maurice Cherry interviews designers, developers, and other creators of color weekly.
* [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2) 
  * Tim Ferriss deconstructs world-class performers from eclectic areas \(investing, sports, business, art, etc.\) to extract the tactics, tools, and routines you can use. This includes favorite books, morning routines, exercise habits, time-management tricks, and much more.
  * I suggest listening to Derek Sivers, Debbie Millman, and David Heinemeier Hansson
* [Unmistakeable Creative](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/unmistakable-creative/id352721366?mt=2)

  * StartUp is a podcast series about what it’s really like to get a business off the ground.
  * In Season 1, Alex Blumberg told the story of launching this business, Gimlet Media, a podcast network.
  * In Season 2, Lisa Chow joined Alex to follow an entirely new company: a company called Dating Ring, founded by two women in their 20s, outsiders in the male-dominated world of Silicon Valley.
  * In Season 3, rather than following one company over many episodes, they are telling stories about many companies that all have something in common: their companies are stuck, and they know they need to make a big change.
